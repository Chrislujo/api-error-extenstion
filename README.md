# api-error-extenstion
API Error Detector is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of monitoring API errors directly within your browser. Instead of manually inspecting network requests in the browser's DevTools, this extension highlights and displays failed API responses, allowing for faster troubleshooting and debugging.
